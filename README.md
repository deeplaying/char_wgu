#A minimal character level LSTM network built with Tensorflow to generate sequences of texts

*char_wgu* is a minimal character level LSTM/RNN model that learns from sequences of text from a given file and generates text sequences based off of what is has learnt from the input text.
This project was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's insanely popular post, <link>. 
*char_wgu* is built with Tensorflow, and support for the latest releases will be maintained.
