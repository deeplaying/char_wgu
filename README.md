# char_wgu

*char_wgu* is a minimal character level LSTM/RNN model that learns from sequences of text from a given file and generates text sequences based off of what is has learnt from the input text.
This project was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's insanely popular post, [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). 
*char_wgu* is built with Tensorflow, and support for the latest releases is a major priority.
